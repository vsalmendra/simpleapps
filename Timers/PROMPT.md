write me a single page application using react that has two timers: a stopwatch (minutes and seconds) and a countdown
timer (hour, minutes and seconds). The app should allow setting the value of the countdown timer, starting it,
stopping it and resetting it to the initial value. The app should allow starting the stopwatch, stopping it and
resetting it to zero. Once the countdown timer expires it should start blinking. Both timers should be stacked in
vertical and should fit the vertical space and 1/3 of a the horizontal space of typical HD screen. Number should be big.
Black background and white (not too white) numbers.
